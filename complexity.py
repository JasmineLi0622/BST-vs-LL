'''Complexity analysis X vs Y
Though there are some fluctuations in the plot which may caused by other running programs, in general, 
the plot shows an increasing trend. Also, as the size grows, the increase in running time slightly
slows down, which implies the complexity might be logarithmic. But the increase rate seems to be
faster than that of a logarithmic complexity.

'''Complexity analysis X vs Y, Y2 and Y3
Generally, the line falls between the ideal linear complexity line and the logarithmic complexity lineï¼Œ
The line grows faster than logarithmic complexity line, but slower than linear complexity line. 

The reason behind this might be: the randomly created Binary Search Tree is not restricted to be 
balanced.
For a Binary Search Tree,the maximum times of comparison while searching is the height of the tree.
If a Binary Search Tree of size n is balanced, then the searching complexity has the same orders of 
magnitude with log2(n). On the contrary, the worst situation is that a list of monotone increasing 
or decreasing numbers are generated to create a Binary Search Tree, consequently, this Binary Search 
Tree is similar to a linked list, and the searching complexity is O(n).
Since our code generates the Binary Search Tree randomly and takes the average searching time, so
the line does not follow exactly the same as Y2 or Y3.

To fix this, we should try to keep the generate tree balanced. For example, we can test if the tree
will become unbalanced when a number is inserted, if true, then we can either cancel this insert progress, 
generate another number and try insert again, or try to rotate the tree to keep it balanced.

''' Complexity analysis X vs Y, Y2, Y3 and Y4
The shape of Y4 appears to be linear, and it always falls above Y2, Y, Y3 which means the searching 
efficiency of linked list is lower than that of binary search tree at any size. Also, as the n 
increases, the searching efficiency gap between linked list and binary search tree becomes much larger.
In conclusion, the bianry search tree is much more efficient when searching than linked list, and thus
it is more suitable for searching than linked list.
